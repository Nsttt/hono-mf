## Description

Implement the Pure Runtime approach in the host application using createInstance from @module-federation/enhanced/runtime to dynamically load and register the remote application

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Host uses createInstance from @module-federation/enhanced/runtime
- [ ] #2 Host registers remote1 pointing to http://localhost:3001/mf-manifest.json
- [ ] #3 Host can dynamically import and initialize remote modules
- [ ] #4 Remote module loading includes proper error handling
- [ ] #5 Host can successfully consume exposed modules from remote
- [ ] #6 Integration works without static configuration dependencies
<!-- AC:END -->
